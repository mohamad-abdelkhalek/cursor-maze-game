# Cursor Maze Game

The **Cursor Maze Game**! This is a simple interactive game created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal is to navigate your cursor from the "Start" block to the "End" block without touching any of the walls.

## Features

- **Game Start**: Hover over the "Start" block to begin the game. A message will display that you've started.
- **Game Over**: If you touch any of the walls, the game will end. The walls will turn red, and the game status will display "GAME OVER!"
- **You Win**: If you successfully hover over the "End" block without touching any of the walls, you win! The game status will show "YOU WIN!" and the walls will turn green.

## How to Play

2. Move your cursor through the maze, avoiding the walls.
